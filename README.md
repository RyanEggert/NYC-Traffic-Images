# NYC-Traffic-Images
Gathers real-time images from New York City's network of traffic cameras.

This is in an early stage of development. This was a quick experiment into automatically gathering images from New York City's network of traffic cameras. These could be stiched into long videos from known geographic locations and used to test and validate vision systems. The realized frame-rate from this system (as-is) was not great, and videos from this system weren't going to be of particularly high quality.
